I'm really just messing around trying to remember
,figure out how to use and implement c++ code. 
My intentions are to create a program that can combat
This Toxic Cyberstalker (Parasite) I've had for the
Last ten plus years. Who keeps placing me in a
virtual machine in EVERY Device that I purchase.
That I Can't Seem To Dig my Way out of. As he feeds 
Lies to my screen, Meanwhile, Making himself the 
"Owner" Of "My" System Files I pad for to use. At the
Same time he/she/they limit. How much of the

Hardware (that I purchased ) to use.

So... If you are willing to post some links explaining
Certain Functions, Headers, key words (such as Int,
Main(),ect)
Or Aid me by pushing A correct Version Of what Code
You see me attempting to LEARN. I would Greatly
Appreciate You Time and Consideration.

P.S. Cyber Stalkers May have Changed or Altered 
ANYthing That I post Here on Github. Please be
 careful Before opening ANY of My Files. Templates
Or objects that I attempt to Post!

Sorry for the long read, but THANK YOU for your
 time and patients.
